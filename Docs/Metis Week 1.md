# Metis Week 1


## Summary and Thoughts
First week of Metis is finally over. Most of the material covered were libraries or tools that I was already familiar with but it was great to still learn certain tricks that I wasn't aware of.  

Most importantly, scraping and cleaning MTA data made me truly realize how messy real world data can be - nothing like Kaggle with all those curated datasets. The project itself led me to deeply appreciate the Pandas library. Shoutout to Wes McKinney!
